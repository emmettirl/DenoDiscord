# Deno Discord

A new attempt at some functionality originally planned for [TeicBot]. 
This repository contains the source code for a Discord Bot, which can pull YouTube video IDs from messages, and create YouTube playlists from them.

The main purpose is to Learn Deno 2.0, since it's new and I find it interesting.  

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need Deno 2.0, and NPM. 
Install all dependencies and run the following:

``` CLI
deno run --env --allow-env --allow-read --allow-write --allow-net --watch-hmr main.ts
```
